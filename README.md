# DBSCAN

Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm that is commonly used in data mining and machine learning.
Based on a set of points, DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement (usually Euclidean distance) and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.

In this repository, there is a DBSCAN document which defines and explains the algorithm and its usage with examples. The parameters required to be used in the algorithm are elaborated along with some associated terminologies. Some tips for best parameter estimation is also provided. The document also enlists some pro's and cons of using the algorithm.

Also, there are two python scripts each for implementing and visualising some cluster data points respectively.
